# Content-Management-System (CMS)

Currently, the CMS system is under construction.

This CMS system runs well on virtual private servers from 1 core and up.

The system uses R3M as framework, a helper set of tools & uses the MVC&PS (Model, View, Controller & Plugin, Service) model.

It has support for the R3M language which start with {{R3M}} and can be used in `.json`, `.js` & `.tpl`.

The CMS makes it possible to easily add subdomains and domains.

Configure the controllers which get called by certain routes, or redirect them.

Respond with powerful templates which utilizes data from `.json` files & scripts from `.js`, scripted with R3M & javascript.

Default plugins (over 300 of them) & custom plugins can target certain services, functions & modifiers. 

It uses Docker to virtualize a Debian based system with apache2, php7.4 and cron services.

It can update via cron services or manually via a button in the CMS.

You can import or export your domains, cms & core sites are included. 

We hope Debian comes with php 8.0 soon, so we can upgrade.

The price will be around &euro; 79,- / year for the CMS and a VPS with 1 core will cost around &euro; 150,- / year comes together &euro; 229,- / year which make it around &euro; 19,- a month.

It's pretty fast, and we think fun to learn!
